OSM Destination Signs
=====================

This is a tool to show information stored in OSM in the form of destination_sign relations or destination tags on ways.
The code provided in this repository creates signs from relations and direction tags. Regular street destination signs are rendered by https://github.com/mueschel/OsmDestinationToSVG.


Supported tagging features:
---

* destination tags, including destination:lang:XX and destination:symbol
* distance and time
* colour:text, colour:back, colour:arrow
* direction of route from geometry of ways and nodes
* additional sources from guidepost node: image, mapillary, website, operator
* ref numbers of ways are taken from destination:ref on relations or ref on ways or ref on hiking routes the way belongs to

Usage
---
All code is included in the code directory - a Perl script generating the signs, a JavaScript file for control on the users' side and a style file to render the HTML output.

The example directory contains a Leaflet map page with markers for interesting points. It needs an additional library to load data from Overpass (leaflet-layerjson.js) which can be found here: https://github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-layerJSON and leaflet-permalink.js which can be found here: https://github.com/shramov/leaflet-plugins/ 

API
---
A simple API is available to retrieve information from a given sign:

`code/generate.pl?nodeid=123456789&namedroutes&fromarrow&format=json`

The available arguments are:

* `nodeid` - required, gives the node of a destination sign to be evaluated (required)
* `namedroutes` - include the names for names of routes
* `fromarrow` - take 'from' information into account and add arrows showing the actual direction of arrows on signs
* `distunit=(m|km|mi)` - convert distance to either meter, kilometer or miles.
* `format=json` - to get all information in plain JSON only. If not specified, output contains a HTML rendering as well as data.
